The code "run_analysis.R" combines the test and training data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. It then calculates the mean of all columns containing "mean" or "std" (standard deviation) in the name for each activity (there are six activities) for each person (there are 30 people).
