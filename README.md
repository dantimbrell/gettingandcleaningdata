Created for Coursera's "Getting and Cleaning Data" course. 

The code "run_analysis.R" combines the test and training data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. It then calculates the mean of all columns containing "mean" or "std" (standard deviation) in the name for each activity (there are six activities) for each person (there are 30 people).

The full list of parameters originally harvested by Samsung are shown below along with their descriptions. Any parameter containing "mean" or "std" were used in my code.
